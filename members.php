        <p class="lead">When you ask someone why they joined Theta Tau, you'll probably get a diverse set of answers. Some join because they seek professional growth. Other join to meet more engineers in their major and across disciplines. Some are attracted to networking opportunities, or have heard that Theta Tau is the oldest and largest Professional Engineering Fraternity in the country.</p>
        <p class="lead">However, when you ask someone why they stayed, and continue to participate in the Fraternity. You'll likely ever hear one answer. <b>It's the people</b>. Among all other things, it's the people, their values and their culture that make your college experience, and what you will remember years after you graduate. And this is especially true with Theta Gamma Chapter, which is made of some of the most diverse and extraordinary Engineers you will ever meet. These people are going places.</p>
        <p class="lead"><b> Get to know them.</b></p>

        <p class="lead opensans">In Theta Gamma Chapter, we have a tradition of giving each pledge a "Big" Brother that is their mentor and gateway to the fraternity. Often, the Big and "Little" pledge keep a close bond, and the Littles carry on traditions with their own Littles. And over time, a family is built, with deep connections that span for generations, all the way up to the very founders of our Chapter.</p>
